<!-- Welcome to jGreat!

This is a sample html page for you to try out some of jGreat's DOM manipulation
functionality.  You can safely remove this file as well as sample.css if so desired.

To get started, open this file in your browser. -->

    <h1>Welcome to jGreat!</h1>

    <p>First, let's checkout one of jGreat's primary features, the ability to register
    callbacks on your DOMs load. Try uncommenting this script tag to see
    a jGreat event handler in action.</p>

      <!--
      <script type="text/javascript">
        $g(() => alert('DOM loaded!'))
      </script>
      -->

    <p>Nice!  You can add alerts, console.log() to debug, or even schedule API calls.</p>

    <p>Now let's fix up that boring list by adding a new class our &#60li&#62 elements.  To add the class
    'pretty' (from our required sample.css file), open your broswer console window
    (In chrome, right click the window and select 'inspect'). Try this command:</p>

        <h4>$g('li').addClass('pretty')</h4>

      <p>Cool, we added a css class to all elements with an &#60li&#62 tag. Dang,
      that looks pretty! Almost too pretty... let's make thinks more serious by
      running:</p>

        <h4>$g('li').parent().append('&#60p&#62hey settle down!&#60/p&#62')</h4>

      <p>Awesome!  we've create a new &#60p&#62 tag DOM Node element and appended it to our &#60ul&#62
      Nice.  But on second thought, let's keep the party going and remove that
      crumudgeonly &#60p&#62 tag by running:</p>

        <h4>$g('p').remove()</h4>

      <p>Nice, now we can party.  Try out some of the other DOM manipulation functionality,
      go wild!  For more information, check out the documentation at
